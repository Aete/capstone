### This dashboard is the result of the data processing, modeling, and analysis of work zones and automobile collisions in New York City from 2016 to 2019. The dashboard contains two versions: 

The first version is a comprehensive look at crashes on all NYC roads and intersections in this time period. By clicking on a road segment or intersection, the dashboard up will update with information about historical crashes including statistics about crashes by hour of the day and crashes that resulted in injury/fatality.  

The second version of the dashboard focuses on historical work zone events. The work zone events are colored by their cluster assignment and scaled to represent the number of crashes occurring in the proximity of a work zone during the time it was active. These cluster assignments are a result of the methodology described here.
