## Jupyter Notebooks

Some of these notebooks will require data sets that are not present in the data folder. 

To download raw data please follow instructions in each of the following notebooks:
1. lion_00_data_wrangling_&_filtration
2. crash_00_data_wrangling
3. wz_00_data_wrangling
4. 511_00_Data_Cleaning_and_Filtering

Also, data used in some of the notebooks will require data produced by other notebooks. Therefore it is important to run notebooks sequentially and make sure you have the required data in the cleaned data folder. Please follow instructions inside notebooks.

Recommended sequence of running notebooks:
1. lion_00_data_wrangling_&_filtration
2. crash_00_data_wrangling
3. wz_00_data_wrangling
4. wz_01_EDA
5. wz_02_counting_crashes
6. wz_03_join_to_511

**Add sequence for 511 data**
